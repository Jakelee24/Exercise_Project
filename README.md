# Mesh Simplification
### Introduction
In computer graphics, accounting for Level of detail involves decreasing the complexity of a 3D model representation as it moves away from the viewer or according to other metrics such as object importance, viewpoint-relative speed or position. Level of detail techniques increase the efficiency of rendering by decreasing the workload on graphics pipeline stages, usually vertex transformations. The reduced visual quality of the model is often unnoticed because of the small effect on object appearance when distant or moving fast.

This project is base on the [MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-837-computer-graphics-fall-2012/assignments/MIT6_837F12_assn0.pdf "MIT OpenCourseWare") to implement the paper [Surface Simplification Using Quadric Error Metrics](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jrs/meshpapers/GarlandHeckbert2.pdf "Surface Simplification Using Quadric Error Metrics") to simplify the mesh on the OpenGL rendering.

### Run Code
Plaese use the Visual Studio 2015, and open up the sln, compile it, and you are ready to go.
